# Getting Started

## Installation

### Easy Setup: Clone the Encore-UI-Template

[Encore-UI-Template](https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui-template) is a project template to help get things started with new Encore-UI based apps. You must be a Rackspace employee in order to access the repository.

To use, simply copy the repo in to your new project and run an NPM/Bower install. All Encore-UI files will be included after the dependencies have been installed.

### Manual Setup: Create a New Angular Project

If you're unable to (or prefer not to) use the Encore-UI-Template, you need to manually create a new Angular project. Once set up, add the Encore-UI files to your page either through the CDN or Bower:

#### CDN

To use the CDN in your app, do the following:

1. Install and include the dependencies listed in [bower.json](./bower.json) (items listed in devDependencies are not required)

2. Include the Encore CSS file in the `<head>` of your index.html (before the CSS for your app):

    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://95c7050854423f809e66-6999ba0e7a4f47d417515fb3f08fa9b8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/encore-ui-0.11.3.min.css">
    ```

3. Include the Encore JS file (**Dependencies must be included before this line**):

    ```
    <script src="https://95c7050854423f809e66-6999ba0e7a4f47d417515fb3f08fa9b8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/encore-ui-tpls-0.11.3.min.js"></script>
    ```

4. Add 'encore.ui' as a dependency in your app.js module declaration. For example:

    ```
    angular.module('myApp', ['encore.ui']);
    ```

#### Bower

If you have a static server that you'd like to build your files off of, you can install Encore-UI via [Bower](http://bower.io):

```
bower install encore-ui
```

## Using Components

Now that Encore-UI is installed, you may begin using its components.

Very likely, the first component you'll want to get in to is `<rx-app>`. If you used the Encore-UI-Template, rxApp is already set up in the index.html file. If not, you'll want to read through [the rxApp documentation](http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/component/rxApp) for more information on its use (including how to use `<rx-page>`).

From there, just start building pages, using whatever Encore-UI component is needed.
